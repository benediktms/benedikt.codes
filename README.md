# The bengineering source code repository
This is where I talk about all the project, randomg thoughts and other random things that pop into my head. This project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/)

This page is mainly used for me to document things so that I don't forget them, usually if it's something that confused me or I found interesting. The information may not be 100% accurate, in fact I may be completley wrong. If so and you find yourself with a spare few minutes, do point this out to me, I'd be greatful.

Enjoy your stay and have a nice day.
